# Stop Out Monitor MT4

This code is designed to monitor the margin call level of a forex trading account and alert the trader when the account is close to a stop out or margin call. It retrieves real-time data for each currency pair and calculates the number of pips remaining until a margin call. If the number of pips remaining is less than or equal to 10.0, an alert or notification is triggered. Additionally, the code includes a function to implement necessary actions to prevent a stop out or margin call, such as closing losing positions, adding funds to the account, or adjusting risk management settings.

## How it Works

1. The `GetPipsRemaining` function is called to retrieve real-time data for each currency pair. This function takes a currency pair as a parameter and returns the number of pips remaining based on the fetched data.

2. The `CalculatePipsUntilMarginCall` function calculates the number of pips remaining until a margin call. It takes the margin call level for the account and the current account balance as parameters and returns the calculated pips remaining.

3. The `AlertStopOutOrMarginCall` function is called to notify the trader when the account is close to a stop out or margin call. It takes the number of pips remaining as a parameter and triggers an alert or notification if the pips remaining is less than or equal to 10.0.

4. The `PreventStopOutOrMarginCall` function is called to implement necessary actions to prevent a stop out or margin call. This function should be customized by the trader to include actions such as closing losing positions, adding funds to the account, or adjusting risk management settings.

5. In the `OnInit` function, real-time data is retrieved for each currency pair using the `GetPipsRemaining` function. The number of pips remaining until a margin call is calculated using the `CalculatePipsUntilMarginCall` function. The trader is alerted if the account is close to a stop out or margin call using the `AlertStopOutOrMarginCall` function. Finally, if the number of pips remaining until a margin call is less than or equal to 10.0, the necessary actions to prevent a stop out or margin call are executed by calling the `PreventStopOutOrMarginCall` function.
